Developed a Python script utilizing the Scapy library to parse Wireshark files, extracting key information such as timestamp, source, destination, protocol, length, and packet details. Implemented a report generation feature to organize and present the data in a structured format. The script enhances network analysis by providing concise, readable reports, facilitating easy review and modification. Skills utilized include packet analysis, network protocol understanding, and proficiency in Python scripting.

The Python code processes input files in pcap (Wireshark) format, producing a report in CSV format.
